# Deep-Learning-Tutorial
Contains introductory material (as a .pptx presentation) and code (as a .ipynb notebook) for Neural Networks, CNNs, and RNNs.

## How to run the Notebooks

`Colaboratory` is required to run the notebooks. To install it, go to your Google drive, then right click into an empty space. 
Your menu options should be (from top to bottom) `New Folder...`, `Upload Files...`, `Upload Folder...`, and so on. Go to `more`
and scroll down the new menu then click on `Connect more apps`. A new window pops up and you can type `colab` in the search bar.
